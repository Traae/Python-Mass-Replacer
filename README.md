# MassReplacer

A program for finding and replacing a regular expression match with new plain text.

Use a Json Dictionary to convert many strings at once!

### I've copied code & learned from:
- [Python-grep by heyhuyen](https://github.com/heyhuyen/python-grep)
- [Grep in 9 lines of python by Robert Elder](https://blog.robertelder.org/grep-clone-in-9-lines-of-python/)
- A bunch of minor stuff from stack overflow.
